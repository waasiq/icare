# iCare

iCare is a python application which makes use of your webcam in order to detect the emotion on your face. iCare uses modules from [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). Detection of emotions is done mathematically by calculating  difference between various specific points for each emotion.
